From way back in 2001 when Bryce 3D was super cool. After spending a lot of time in code based POV-Ray and other ray-tracer programs, this visual tool was the best thing ever - landscapes, blobs and textures drag'n'drop style! It's kind of painful to look at today, but useful for remembering my own creative and techincal progress from then to now :)
