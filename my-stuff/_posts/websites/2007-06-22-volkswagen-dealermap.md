When “facelifting” Volkswagen.dk we threw away the old Flash dealer map, and spiced it up with a Google Maps solution instead. I worked closely together with mr. Javascript Morgan Roderick doing the initial planning, and later on Tommy Krogh from Sparkle. My assignment was to come up with the graphical ideas to fitting all the different sorts of dealers into the map and list below. Later on in the process I did the markup and styling as well.
