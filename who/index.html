<h2>About Hamsterboy</h2>

<img class="illustration wrap-alt" src="/assets/images/content/hammy-sketch.jpg" alt="Hamsterboy" />
<p>So... yeah... I guess I&#x27;d better introduce myself. Hello... I am Daniel Aakjær Sørensen, the founder and the owner of Hamsterboy. First of all I hope you don't mind the informal tone here on my website. Hamsterboy is in every way a professional creative service, but I am not the type claiming to be corporate in any way - in my opinion an informal one-to-one talk is the most effective and natural approach.</p>

<p>In short I love creating websites. I love the process a website undergoes from the initial analysis and narrowing down on a clients needs and wishes, sketching and visualizing solutions to match these needs, to implementing the design and adding all the layers of browser functionality. I really enjoy being part of all of the steps in this process.</p>

<h2>Services</h2>

<div class="row">
	<div class="half">
		<h3>Analysis and planning</h3>
		<p>Being able to make good decisions early on in a project is vital for the outcome. Identifying the needs of the client, visualizing how people are going to interact with the final product, and structuring complex flows via wireframes, are some of the skills I use in the startup phase of a project.</p>

		<p>There are tons of buzz-words for this kind of work, but I have tried to limit my capabilities to the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Workflows/wireframes/roughs</li>
			<li>User experience/usability</li>
			<li>Re-designing existing flows</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="half last">
		<h3>Design</h3>
		<p>I have been designing websites and various user interfaces since 2002. I try to constantly push my limits and skills, and question what I already consider to be facts. I always try to ride the balance between staying up-to-date with the newest trends and at the same time staying true to my own style.</p>
		
		<p>Here are the design areas where I can make a difference in a project:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Web design</li>
			<li>Responsive design</li>
			<li>Designs for handheld device</li>
			<li>Makeovers for existing designs</li>
			<li>Illustrations for web and print</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

		<h3>Development</h3>
		<p>My perhaps biggest passion lies in the area of front-end development. There is a major aspect of satisfaction in taking a finished design and moving it to the browser. Watching it slowly come alive by styling typography, grids, responsive behaviors, adding illustrations, real content, advanced user interactions, preparing print styles and much much more - while at the same time marking sure that everything will work across the many browsers and devices, the ever growing number of different sized viewports, and the endless user specific configurations. </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>HTML/HTML5, CSS1, CSS2 and CSS3</li>
			<li>Cross browser compatibility and testing</li>
			<li>Responsive behavior</li>
			<li>SEO</li>
			<li>JS functionality, jQuery/Prototypejs (more on this <a href="#i-am-not-a-programmer">here</a>)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="half last">
		<h3>Random art</h3>
		<p>Working on random art projects in the real world complements my many hours in front of a computer. Ever since I was a small boy in my grandmothers kitchen, I have enjoyed drawing, doing paper cuts, molding clay, and painting.</p>
		
		<p>This is usually not a service I offer professionally, but it is still a big part of me, and in time I hope to be able to transition some of my clients to this type of work.</p>
		
		<p>Here are some of my current areas of interest regarding art in the "real world":</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Hand drawn art for chairs, tables etc.</li>
			<li>Wall murals</li>
			<li>Wall stickers</li>
			<li>Posters</li>
		</ul>

<h2>About me</h2>

<a class="illustration wrap-alt" href="/images/content/me-me-me.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/content/me-me-me.jpg" alt="profile image" width="150" /></a>

<p>I was born in Denmark on september 7th, 1980. I had my first computer, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_600">Commadore Amiga 600</a> with a 30 mb harddrive, when I was 13 years old. With this and Deluxe Paint III I made my first animation of a worm moving across the screen - truth is that it looked more like a electrified cheese stick, but I was a happy camper anyway.</p>

<p>I had my first PC when I was 17, which quiet was late compared other teenagers at the time. As a kid I was never really a gamer-type like a lot of my friends. I preferred sports and outdoor activities and this has not changed much since then. When I finish work in front of the computer I love doing cross-fit, kitesurfing, running, cycling, boxing etc. Pretty much anything that involves exercise, adrenaline and fresh air.</p>


<h3>Why Hamsterboy?</h3>

<p>So why did I name my company "Hamsterboy"? First of all I was getting really tired of unpronounceable and fancy web 2.0 names, so I decided to try and find a less pompous one that would match my informal personality a bit better. For some reason people have always been teasing me with my wast daily intake of cereals, müsli, oats - and somewhere along the way someone named it "hamster-food" which then turned into the nickname "Hamsterboy".</p>
