<p>Don’t we just all love the nice crash report window replacing a couple of hours worth of blood, sweat and tears in everyones favorite program Photoshop? And is usually followed by some sort of rage attack on the mouse og enter-key… Well, <a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/tagged/cs4cr">this guy</a> took his time to write Adobe a couple of detailed and pretty sarcastic crash reports. Even the guys at Adobe must be laughing while reading these, despite the obvious frustration he is trying to describe.</p>
