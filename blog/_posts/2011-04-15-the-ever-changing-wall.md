<p>I <span class="caps">WAAANT</span>! This might not be the latest thing, but I just discovered it so bear with me please :) Just imagine being able to not only change your wall every day if you wanted to, but to actually draw, write, design on it as well. Well this pixel wall makes it real. <a href="http://www.wix.com/amirko/home">This russian</a> guy came up with the concept… looks like he has some other pretty interesting projects too. Check out his <a href="http://www.wix.com/amirko/home#!__appartments">appartment interior design</a> if you have the time.</p>
