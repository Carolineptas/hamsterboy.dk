### Warmup

800 m run

Basic warmup followed by some random ring dips and strict pull ups

### WOD

* 30 muscle ups (scaled down to the bar)

**My time: 11:06** (freakin' tough on the hands)

Most of the people scaled this one down to a 12 min. AMRAP - 5 strict pull-ups and 5 ring dips. The guy next to me quit after 16 muscle ups when he lost a 4 cm slice of his skin on his hand.

... and just for the fun of it...

* 3 min. of stomach exercises
* 100 burpees (finished 90 within the 8-9 minutes)
