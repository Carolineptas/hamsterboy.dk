<p>I am still a complete ExpressionEngine noob and last night i tried to find an alternative to my current workflow for posting blog entries – I really enjoy working in Textmate and the whole idea of writing and editing website content in a oldschool <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> textarea is just started to bother me.</p>

<p>After some Google’ing I happend to bump into a great article about <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/from-textmate-to-expressionengine/">blogging directly from within Textmate</a>!</p>

<p>Check out some of the features in the blogging bundle in this <a href="http://macromates.com/screencast/blogging_take_two.mov">screencast</a> link by Allan Odgaard.</p>

<p>Basically there is nothing to it. A quick module-install in EE and a bit of connecting between the Textmate blogging bundle and the EE MetaWeblog <span class="caps">API</span>, and Voila!… I am now able to post blogs without having to access the EE admin and uploading images is as simply as dragging the images to Textmate – my life just got so much easier. Woohoo!</p>
