<p>I always tend to forget these things after a while – especially the firewire mode when transferring large amounts of data…</p>

<ul>
	<li>shift – <strong>Safe Mode</strong>. Booting with the shift key depressed starts OS X in Safe Mode with Account preferences ignored and unessential kernal extensions / kexts disabled.</li>
	<li>option – <strong>Startup Manager</strong>. Booting with the option key depressed starts OS X with the Startup Manager which allows the user to select which OS or partition from which to boot.</li>
	<li>Mouse button – <strong>Eject Media</strong>. When the user boots with the mouse key depressed, any media in the drive such as a <span class="caps">DVD</span> or CD is ejected.</li>
	<li>cmd v – <strong>Verbose Boot</strong>. If this key command is held down when booting, all the startup messages that are typically hidden will be displayed. This is an excellent method for debugging booting issues.</li>
	<li>c – <strong>Boot from CD/DVD</strong>. Booting with the “C” key held will tell the system to boot directly from a CD/DVD in the drive.</li>
	<li>t – <strong>Target Mode</strong>. If the “T” key is held during the bootup, the computer will be placed in target mode. This basically allows the computer to be accessed by other systems as a FireWire drive. Other computers can read, write, or mount the target mode system just like any other FireWire drive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Bootup Shortcuts</h3>
