It has been a while since I first added this to “My Likes” on Vimeo. No clue why I forgot to post it on my website… A really inspiring video by a true artist with a passion everyone should envy. Nothing but amazing how this guys captures angles, frames, tells his story and creates an absolutely beautiful video.
